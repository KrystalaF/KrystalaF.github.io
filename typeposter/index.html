<div>Kultursita is a popular slab serif typeface with 12 styles and family package options available. Characteristics of the Nudista typface were used as inspiration to create Kulturista by paying attention to the detail of character porportions and weight. Kulturista was created by Tomas Brousil, a type designer, and published by the Suitcase Type Foundry July 23, 2009. This can be used for headlines and can be paried with proxima nova for body text to create a harmounious pairing.</div>
